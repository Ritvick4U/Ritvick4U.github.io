                <br>
                from Questa
                Overview
                The Rocket is made of 2 liter bottles and is launched using water and pressure. The water Rocket only
                works on
                Sir Isaac Newton's Third law. The third law states
                “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”
                Obesation
                Fold parachute and put the parachute in the deployer. Next,stretch the rubber band over the parachute
                deployer,and put it a pin 2.Then,hold the cardboard.Flap down and put the lock flap in the lock pin.Pour
                600-750
                mL of water and put it on the launcher.It is pressurized using a bicycle pump.After 15-20 pumps,the
                water rocket
                is ready to be released.With the explosion of water,the rocket shoots up in the air. As the rocket,the
                air
                pressure on the top unlocks the the lock pin.While the rocket goes up,speed decreases and the pressure
                on the
                cardboard flap decreases.As the results, The cardboard flap comes up, releasing From the pin. Thus The
                parachute
                opens and will float all the way down as slow as possible.
                Materials
                2 2 liter plastic bottles
                tape( Most likely Duck Tape)
                A parachute
                Soft wood
                Strings
                Garbage bag
                Paper clips
                Rubber bands
                Goals
                The Water Rocket has to take the most time to came all the way back down.
                The Water Rocket Had to go as high as possible.
