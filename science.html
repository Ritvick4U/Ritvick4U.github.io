                from Questa
                Overview
                The Rocket is made of 2 liter bottles and is launched using water and pressure. The water Rocket only works on
                Sir Isaac Newton's Third law. The third law states
                “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”
                Obesation
                Fold parachute and put the parachute in the deployer. Next,stretch the rubber band over the parachute
                deployer,and put it a pin 2.Then,hold the cardboard.Flap down and put the lock flap in the lock pin.Pour 600-750
                mL of water and put it on the launcher.It is pressurized using a bicycle pump.After 15-20 pumps,the water rocket
                is ready to be released.With the explosion of water,the rocket shoots up in the air. As the rocket,the air
                pressure on the top unlocks the the lock pin.While the rocket goes up,speed decreases and the pressure on the
                cardboard flap decreases.As the results, The cardboard flap comes up, releasing From the pin. Thus The parachute
                opens and will float all the way down as slow as possible.
