        <b>WANT TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY TENIS??!!</b> Well then if you do then you are at the right place.n order to
        know
        how to play tennis,<br>
        a good understanding of the tennis rules and court dimensions of the game must be understood. Tennis is
        played
        between two <br>
        players, this is called singles or two teams of two players, four in all, this is called doubles. Play
        starts
        when the playerv
        whose turn it is to serve attempts to hit a ball into play. Play will then continue should the receiver
        manage
        to return the<br>
        ball back to his opponent. This phase is called a rally. The point is contested between the players. This
        rally
        continues<br>
        until either the ball lands out of play, or hitâ€™s the net without managing to pass over to the opponents
        side
        or bounces twice<br>
        before a player can return it to his opponent. The primary rule is that a player can only hit the ball once
        before returning<br>
        it to his opponent.The point is won by either player whose opponent causes one of these actions to happen:
        Points are played for until one<br>
        player wins a game by accumulating four points with a difference of at least two over his opponent. Games
        are
        won once <br>
        one player has won 6 games to win a set or if necessary, continues as the rules require that a set can only
        be
        won by a<br>
        two clear games margin over the opponent for example: (7-5 games). Matches are made up of 3 or 5 sets. Once
        a
        player has<br>
        won 2 sets in a 3 set match, or 3 sets in a 5 set match play is then concluded and the winner declared
        because
        the opponent<br>
        cannot catch the winner so the match is finished without all the sets being played.<br>
